## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I start capturing clipboard items?**
A: Klyria automatically saves items when you copy them. You can also use the Share Sheet extension or the Klyria keyboard to save items directly.

**Q: Where is my clipboard data stored?**
A: All clipboard data is encrypted and stored locally on your device. With Klyria Pro, you can optionally enable iCloud sync to access your clips across all your devices.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes. Klyria uses end-to-end encryption (ChaChaPoly) to protect all your clipboard data. Your clips are encrypted before they leave memory, and only you can decrypt them.

### Features

**Q: What's the difference between Free and Pro?**
A:
- **Free:** 30 clip limit, end-to-end encryption, text & image support, search
- **Pro:** Unlimited clips, iCloud sync, encrypted archive/import, priority support

**Q: How do I enable biometric authentication?**
A: Go to Settings → Security → Enable Face ID/Touch ID lock.

**Q: Can I save images?**
A: Yes! Klyria supports both text and images. Simply copy an image and it will be saved to your clipboard history.

**Q: How do I search my clipboard history?**
A: Use the search bar at the top of the main screen. Klyria searches through all your saved text clips instantly.

### Clipboard Capture

**Q: Why aren't my clips being saved automatically?**
A: Check Settings → Clipboard Capture → "Capture while app is open" is enabled. By default, Klyria only captures when the app is in the foreground for privacy.

**Q: Can I prevent duplicate clips?**
A: Yes. Go to Settings → Clipboard Capture → Enable "De-duplicate identical clips."

**Q: Why aren't my OTP codes being saved?**
A: For security, OTP codes are blocked by default. You can enable saving them in Settings → Clipboard Capture → "Save OTP codes" (not recommended).

### iCloud Sync (Pro)

**Q: How do I enable iCloud sync?**
A: Go to Settings → iCloud Sync → Enable sync. Make sure you're signed into iCloud on all your devices.

**Q: My clips aren't syncing between devices.**
A:
1. Ensure you're signed into the same iCloud account on all devices
2. Check that iCloud Drive is enabled in iOS Settings
3. Verify Klyria has permission to use iCloud in iOS Settings → Klyria
4. Check your internet connection

**Q: How do I know if sync is working?**
A: Look for the sync status indicator in Settings → iCloud Sync. It will show "Synced" when up to date.

### Archive & Export (Pro)

**Q: How do I export my clipboard history?**
A: Go to Settings → Export Archive → Choose a password → Save the .klyria file.

**Q: How do I import an archive?**
A: Go to Settings → Import Archive → Select your .klyria file → Enter the password.

**Q: Can I transfer my data to a new device?**
A: Yes! Export an encrypted archive, transfer the .klyria file to your new device, and import it. Archives are cross-device compatible.

**Q: I forgot my archive password. Can you recover it?**
A: No. Archive passwords use PBKDF2 key derivation and cannot be recovered. This ensures your data remains secure even if the archive file is compromised.

### Subscription & Billing

**Q: How do I subscribe to Klyria Pro?**
A: Tap the "Upgrade to Pro" button in Settings or on the paywall screen. Choose monthly, yearly, or lifetime.

**Q: How do I cancel my subscription?**
A: Subscriptions are managed through Apple:
1. Open iOS Settings → Your Name → Subscriptions
2. Select Klyria
3. Tap "Cancel Subscription"

**Q: How do I restore my purchase on a new device?**
A: Go to Settings → Restore Purchases. Make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID.

**Q: Do you offer refunds?**
A: Refunds are handled by Apple. Contact Apple Support or request a refund through reportaproblem.apple.com.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The app is crashing or freezing.**
A:
1. Force quit the app and restart it
2. Restart your device
3. Update to the latest version of Klyria
4. If the issue persists, contact support at sidhantchadha@live.com

**Q: I can't delete a clip.**
A: Swipe left on the clip and tap Delete, or tap the clip and use the delete option.

**Q: The keyboard extension isn't working.**
A:
1. Go to iOS Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards
2. Verify Klyria Keyboard is added
3. Enable "Allow Full Access" for paste functionality
4. Try removing and re-adding the keyboard

**Q: Widgets aren't showing my clips.**
A:
1. Long press the widget → Edit Widget
2. Verify Klyria has permission to access your data
3. Try removing and re-adding the widget

### Privacy & Security

**Q: Do you collect any data?**
A: No. Klyria does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to external servers. All data stays on your device (or in your private iCloud if sync is enabled).

**Q: Can you see my clipboard data?**
A: No. All data is encrypted end-to-end on your device. We have no access to your clipboard history.

**Q: What encryption does Klyria use?**
A: Klyria uses ChaChaPoly (ChaCha20-Poly1305) for authenticated encryption and HMAC-SHA256 for content fingerprinting.

**Q: Is iCloud sync secure?**
A: Yes. Clips are encrypted before being uploaded to iCloud. Apple cannot decrypt your data, and neither can we.
